1 - Description

Pyfaces is a Python3.6+ package which helps with working with face recognition tasks.

3 - Installation
----------------

This package makes use of `dlib` which has additional dependencies, depending on your OS. One of the dependencies of the framework is `cmake` which needs to be installed in your machine locally. 

```
$ cmake --version
cmake version 3.10.2

CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
```

If this throws an error, you will need to install it manually, using, for example:

- In Debian-based systems:

```
$ sudo apt install cmake
```

-  In Fedora-based systems:

```
$ sudo dnf install cmake
```

Once solved, the fast way to do it on any system for a user with administration privileges:

```
$ pip3 install pyfaces
```

Note that `dlib` installation may take some time. Really. You can upgrade to the latest release of the framework with:

```
$ pip3 install pyfaces --upgrade
```

This will manage the dependencies (mainly `face_recognition` and `dlib`) for you and install the latest version of the framework.

4 - Basic CLI Usage
-------------------

If everything went correctly (we hope so!), it's time for trying the CLI: `pyfaces`.

```
$ pyfaces --help

Pyfaces CLI | A face recognition tool to make it accesible for everyone and
learn from it to what extent we are exposed.

SUBCOMMANDS:
  List of available commands that can be invoked using Pyfaces CLI.

  <sub_command> <sub_command_options>
    compare             Compare two face files
    extract             Extract faces from a file and save encodings
    guess               Gues which is the most similar candidate to a knowon
                        face

```


5 - JSON-RPC Usage
------------------

For interacting with it using a different programming language, you might use `pyfacesd`.
This will start a JSON RPC server that will let you perform the operations of the framework using the standard JSON RPC specification.

```
$ pyfacesd


                      ____         __
                     |  _ \ _   _ / _| __ _  ___ ___  ___
                     | |_) | | | | |_ / _` |/ __/ _ \/ __|
                     |  __/| |_| |  _| (_| | (_|  __/\__ \
                     |_|    \__, |_|  \__,_|\___\___||___/
                            |___/

To peform the different requests you can usage any JSON-RPC framework and language.
Even `curl` is an option.

```
$ curl -X POST \
 	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 	-d '{"params": {}, "method": "info", "id": "1", "jsonrpc": "2.0"}' \
 	localhost:12012
{
  "result": {
    "name": "Pyfaces 0.1.0 JSON-RPC Server",
    "methods": [
      "compare",
      "config",
      "extract",
      "get_face",
      "get_image",
      "guess",
      "info",
      "set_config"
    ],
    "faces": 3
  },
  "id": "1",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```
